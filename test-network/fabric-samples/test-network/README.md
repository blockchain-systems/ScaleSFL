## Running the test network

You can use the `./network.sh` script to stand up a simple Fabric test network. The test network has two peer organizations with one peer each and a single node raft ordering service. You can also use the `./network.sh` script to create channels and deploy chaincode. For more information, see [Using the Fabric test network](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html). The test network is being introduced in Fabric v2.0 as the long term replacement for the `first-network` sample.

Before you can deploy the test network, you need to follow the instructions to [Install the Samples, Binaries and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation.

## Using the Peer commands
The `setOrgEnv.sh` script can be used to setup the environment variables for the ogrganziations, this will will help to be able to use the `peer` commands directly.

First, ensure that the peer binaries are on your path, and the Fabric Config path is set Assuming that you're in the `test-network` directory.

```bash
 export PATH=$PATH:$(realpath ../bin)
 export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$(realpath ../config)
```

You can then set up the environment variables for each organization. The `./setOrgEnv.sh` command is designed to be run as follows.

```bash
export $(./setOrgEnv.sh Org2 | xargs)
```

You will now be able to run the `peer` commands in the context of Org2. If a different command prompt you can run the same command with Org1 instead.
The `setOrgEnv` script outputs a series of `<name>=<value>` strings. These can then be fed into the export command for your current shell
