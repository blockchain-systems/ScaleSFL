# Kubernetes Test Network 

Starting in release 2.0, Hyperledger introduced the [test-network](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html) 
to serve as both an accelerator and learning resource for running Fabric networks.  In addition to 
providing a study guide for operational patterns, the test-network provided a baseline environment for members of 
the Fabric community to quickly get up to speed with a working, local system, author smart contracts, and develop 
simple blockchain applications.

While test-network provided a solid foundation for casual Fabric development, the over-reliance on
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) introduced tremendous, non-trivial complexity when transitioning 
applications to production.  Without belaboring the many issues and anti-patterns present in the Compose-based 
test network, we'll submit that the best path forward is to _align_ the development and production patterns around a 
common orchestration framework - Kubernetes.

Similar to Fabric, Kubernetes introduces a steep learning curve and presents a dizzying array of operational 
flexibility.  In this guide, we'll outline the design considerations in the [`./network`](../network) 
scripts, provide a supplement to the [Fabric CA Deployment Guide](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployguide/ca-deploy.html), 
and build up to a reference model for realistic production deployments on Kubernetes.

_Ahoy!_ 


## Network Topology  

The Kube test network establishes as consortium among a dedicated ordering organization and two peer organizations.
Participation in the network is managed over a channel, and transactions are committed to the blockchain ledgers by 
invoking the [asset-transfer-basic](https://github.com/hyperledgendary/fabric-ccaas-asset-transfer-basic) 
_Chaincode-as-a-Service_ running in a shared Kubernetes namespace.  Each organization maintains indepedendent TLS 
and ECert CAs for management of local, channel, and user MSP contexts.
